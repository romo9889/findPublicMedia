## Getting Started

This project is set up with Git flow branching:
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- Feature branches - Individual features branched off develop

## Development Workflow

2. Merge completed features back to `develop`
3. When ready for release, merge `develop` to `main`
